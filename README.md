### Hello, there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Deepika, a recent B.Tech graduate and aspiring Machine Learning Engineer, passionate about building intelligent systems using AI agent automation and pretrained models.

âœ¨ Machine Learning Enthusiast: I design and experiment with ML/DL models to tackle real-world problems â€” from healthcare predictions to intelligent automation solutions.

ðŸ§  Deep Learning Explorer: I'm actively exploring neural networks, CNNs, and pretrained models like YOLO and BERT to speed up development and enhance model performance.

ðŸ¤– AI Agent Automation Builder: I work on automating workflows using platforms like n8n, integrating AI agents with APIs, webhooks, and logic to simplify and streamline complex tasks.
